        <h1 id="title">The War of the Rebellion</h1>
        <p>The Civil War in the United States began in 1861, 
          after decades of simmering tensions between northern and southern states over slavery, 
          states’ rights and westward expansion. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 caused seven southern states to secede and form the Confederate States of America; four more states soon joined them. 
          The War Between the States, as the Civil War was also known, ended in Confederate surrender in 1865. 
          The conflict was the costliest and deadliest war ever fought on American soil, with some 620,000 of 2.4 million soldiers killed, 
          millions more injured and much of the South left in ruin.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <h3>Missouri Compromise</h3>
        <p>With the admission of Alabama as a slave state in 1819, the U.S. was equally divided with 11 slave states and 11 free states. 
          Later that year, Congressman James Tallmadge Jr. of New York initiated an uproar in the South when he proposed two amendments to a bill admitting 
          Missouri to the Union as a free state. The first would have barred slaves from being moved to Missouri, and the second would have freed all Missouri slaves 
          born after admission to the Union at age 25. The admission of the new state of Missouri as a slave state would give the slave states a majority 
          in the Senate, while passage of the Tallmadge Amendment would give the free states a majority.</p>

          <p>The Tallmadge amendments passed the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate when five Northern senators voted with all the Southern senators. 
            The question was now the admission of Missouri as a slave state, and many leaders shared Thomas Jefferson's fear of a crisis over slavery—a fear that Jefferson 
            described as "a fire bell in the night". The crisis was solved by the Missouri Compromise, in which Massachusetts agreed to cede control over its relatively 
            large, sparsely populated and disputed exclave, the District of Maine. The compromise allowed Maine to be admitted to the Union as a free state at the same 
            time that Missouri was admitted as a slave state. The Compromise also banned slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of the state of 
            Missouri along parallel 36°30′ north. The Missouri Compromise quieted the issue until its limitations on slavery were repealed by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 
            1854.</p>

            <p>In the South, the Missouri crisis reawakened old fears that a strong federal government could be a fatal threat to slavery. 
              The Jeffersonian coalition that united southern planters and northern farmers, mechanics and artisans in opposition to the threat presented by the 
              Federalist Party had started to dissolve after the War of 1812. It was not until the Missouri crisis that Americans became aware of the political
               possibilities of a sectional attack on slavery, and it was not until the mass politics of Andrew Jackson's administration that this type of organization 
               around this issue became practical.</p>

               <h3>Nullification crisis</h3>
               <p>The American System, advocated by Henry Clay in Congress and supported by many nationalist supporters of the War of 1812 such as John C. Calhoun,
                 was a program for rapid economic modernization featuring protective tariffs, internal improvements at federal expense, and a national bank. 
                 The purpose was to develop American industry and international commerce. Since iron, coal, and water power were mainly in the North, this tax plan was 
                 doomed to cause rancor in the South, where economies were agriculture-based. Southerners claimed it demonstrated favoritism toward the 
                 North.</p>

                 <p>The nation suffered an economic downturn throughout the 1820s, and South Carolina was particularly affected. 
                  The highly protective Tariff of 1828 (called the "Tariff of Abominations" by its detractors), designed to protect American industry by
                   taxing imported manufactured goods, was enacted into law during the last year of the presidency of John Quincy Adams. 
                   Opposed in the South and parts of New England, the expectation of the tariff's opponents was that with the election of Andrew Jackson the tariff
                    would be significantly reduced.</p>

                    <p>By 1828 South Carolina state politics increasingly organized around the tariff issue. When the Jackson administration failed to take any actions 
                      to address their concerns, the most radical faction in the state began to advocate that the state declare the tariff null and void within South 
                      Carolina. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and his vice-president John C. Calhoun, the most effective proponent
                       of the constitutional theory of state nullification through his 1828 "South Carolina Exposition and Protest".</p>

                       <p>Congress enacted a new tariff in 1832, but it offered the state little relief, resulting in the most dangerous sectional crisis
                         since the Union was formed. Some militant South Carolinians even hinted at withdrawing from the Union in response. The newly elected South 
                         Carolina legislature then quickly called for the election of delegates to a state convention. Once assembled, the convention voted to declare 
                         null and void the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 within the state. President Andrew Jackson responded firmly, declaring nullification an act of treason.
                          He then took steps to strengthen federal forts in the state.</p>

                          <p>Violence seemed a real possibility early in 1833 as Jacksonians in Congress introduced a "Force Bill" authorizing the President to use the federal army and navy in order to enforce acts of Congress. 
                            No other state had come forward to support South Carolina, and the state itself was divided on willingness to continue the showdown with the federal government. 
                            The crisis ended when Clay and Calhoun worked to devise a compromise tariff. Both sides later claimed victory. Calhoun and his supporters in South Carolina claimed a 
                            victory for nullification, insisting that it had forced the revision of the tariff. Jackson's followers, however, saw the episode as a demonstration that no single 
                            state could assert its rights by independent action.</p>

                            <p>Calhoun, in turn, devoted his efforts to building up a sense of Southern solidarity so that when another standoff should come, the whole 
                              section might be prepared to act as a bloc in resisting the federal government. As early as 1830, in the midst of the crisis, Calhoun identified 
                              the right to own slaves—the foundation of the plantation agricultural system—as the chief southern minority right being threatened:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote cite="./index.html" id="bloc">I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things.
                              The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent 
                              direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite 
                              elation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states 
                              they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated
                               by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.

                           </blockquote>
                           <p>On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote of this idea, "the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and Southern confederacy the real object. 
                            The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question."</p>

                            <p>The issue appeared again after 1842's Black Tariff. A period of relative free trade followed 1846's Walker Tariff, which had been largely 
                              written by Southerners. Northern industrialists (and some in western Virginia) complained it was too low to encourage the growth of industry.</p>
